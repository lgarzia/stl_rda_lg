# Exploring the STL Region Alliance API Data Sources

The main objective is exploring
[Regional Data Exchange Datasets](https://rdx.stldata.org/)

- apps.stldata.org
- api.stldata.org

Personal Objective is leveraging Streamlit to develop a dashboard for consumption.

The package leverages poetry - in time a whl will be on PyPi - in the interim.

Cloning project and running
`poetry install` should be suffient to get started

`stl-rda-lg run` will start streamlit app
